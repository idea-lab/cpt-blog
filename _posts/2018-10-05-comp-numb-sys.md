Computer Number Systems is the first of three topics in the December
ACSL contest. In this short post, I'll go through the training material
we used in our meeting.

First, we read through
[this](https://betterexplained.com/articles/numbers-and-bases/)
article to get a better sense of why we need different bases in the
first place.

Then, we showed how to convert from base 10 to base n and vice-versa.
After learning these techniques, we began to solve the problem
sets for this topic, which can be found
