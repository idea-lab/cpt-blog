# Hello and Welcome CPT!

Welcome to the first of many blog posts, each describing
a various topic. In this one, I'll be going through the ACSL competition,
placing specific focus on the various topics.

The following is a list of ACSL competitions and their respective topics:
1. ACSL Contest #1 (12/7/2018)
  * Computer Number Systems
  * Recursive Functions
  * Program Simulation
2. ACSL Contest #2 (1/18/2019)
  * Pre/Post/Infix Notation
  * Bit-String Flicking
  * Lisp
3. ACSL Contest #3 (3/1/2019)
  * Boolean Algebra
  * Data Structures
  * Regular Expressions
4. ACSL Contest #4 (4/12/2019)
  * Graph Theory
  * Digital Electronics
  * Assembly

Throughout the year, we'll be first learning these topics and then
solving problems on them. No matter what problem-solving skill level we
started with, I'm hoping we'll all have several "Aha!" moments
throughout the year as we discover something new.

Looking forward to it!
